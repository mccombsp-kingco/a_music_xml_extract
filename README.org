* Introduction

Just having a play at parsing and browsing metadata from the Apple Muisc applicaiton on MacOS.

To get started open Music on your mac and select File->Library->Export Library, then save the file as /Library.xml/ in the directory of this repository for the code as it exists here will find it. I've added ~Library.xml~ to /.gitignore/ so that it won't be shared with the public.

I'm starting with some Python code I had working several years ago, when Music was still called iTunes.
